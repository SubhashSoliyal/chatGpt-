A.I :  Once upon a time, there was a young princess named Isabella who lived in a castle. One day, while walking around the castle grounds, she came across an enchanted lake. Intrigued, she decided to explore the lake and when she did, she found a beautiful golden apple at the bottom. When she picked it up, a magical genie appeared and granted her three wishes. Isabella thought hard about what she wanted and finally decided on wishing for true love, everlasting health, and good luck. The genie smiled and granted her wish with one final warning: that the wishes would only last as long as the apple remained in her possession. With that, Isabella thanked the genie and returned to the castle with her newfound gifts. She lived happily ever after, using her wishes to make the world a better place.
